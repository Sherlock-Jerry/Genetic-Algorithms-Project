# Genetic Algorithms Term Project
This is the term project, of the course Genetic Algorithms Course(MT21104), IIT Kharagpur.
Project Members-
1. R. Raghav
2. Abhay Shukla

The aim of the project is to find the parameters to tune complex controllers for Autonomous Driving, using Genetic Algorithms.
We applied differential evolution, on two methods of lateral vehicle control - Pure Pursuit and Stanley, to calculate their parameters and the parameters of their respective PID controller.

You can go through the project report, for detailed explaination of this project.
